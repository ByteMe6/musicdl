# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Ukrainian and Russian translations of the README.
- A section on exporting playlists from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and other services with TuneMyMusic.
- A tldr page in `docs/tldr/trackfetch.md`.
- Offline pytest suite (81 tests, 100% coverage) that runs in CI on Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Changed
- **Renamed from musicdl to trackfetch**, because the musicdl name is already taken by another project on PyPI. The command, Python module, release binaries and repository URL all changed; old GitHub links redirect. The default output folder is now `~/Music/trackfetch`. To keep using an existing folder and its `done.txt`, pass `-o ~/Music/musicdl`.
- trackfetch is now licensed under the GPL-3.0-or-later instead of MIT. Version 1.0.0 remains available under MIT.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- Batch download from a text file of `Artist - Title` lines, with `#` comments and blank lines ignored.
- Spotify metadata lookup with strict and loose search plus fuzzy best-match scoring.
- Scored YouTube candidate selection that prefers official audio and penalises covers, karaoke, nightcore, sped-up and slowed edits, remixes and reaction videos.
- Best-quality MP3 extraction through yt-dlp and FFmpeg.
- ID3v2.3 tags: title, artist, album, album artist, track number, release date and embedded front cover.
- Resumable runs via `done.txt`, and a failure log with reasons in `failed.txt`.
- `--output`, `--title-only` and `--delay` options.
- PyInstaller spec, plus prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows on x86_64 and ARM64.
- Automated releases: pushing a new version to `master` builds and publishes all binaries.
