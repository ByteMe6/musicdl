<img alt="Terminal recording: trackfetch skips two songs that are already downloaded, finds Daft Punk - One More Time on Spotify, scores five YouTube results, downloads the best one and saves a tagged MP3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/master/.github/assets/demo.svg" width="100%">

<br>

trackfetch reads a plain text file with one `Artist - Title` per line. For every song it looks up the official metadata and cover art on Spotify, picks the best-matching audio on YouTube, and saves an MP3 with complete ID3 tags. Runs are resumable, so you can stop a 1,000-song list at any point and pick it up later.

- **Exact metadata.** The title, every credited artist, album, album artist, track number and release date come from Spotify, not from a YouTube video title.
- **Album art.** The largest Spotify cover is embedded in every file.
- **The right upload.** trackfetch scores five YouTube results per song. Official audio wins; covers, karaoke, nightcore, sped-up, slowed, remix and reaction videos lose.
- **Best quality.** yt-dlp extracts the audio as the highest-quality VBR MP3.
- **Resumable.** Finished songs are logged in `done.txt` and skipped next time. Failures go to `failed.txt` with the reason.
- **Plays everywhere.** Tags are written as ID3v2.3, which Windows Explorer, Apple Music, Android, car stereos and most other players read.
- **Any alphabet.** Cyrillic and other non-Latin titles are matched correctly and kept in filenames. Characters that are illegal in filenames are replaced.
- **No Python needed.** Standalone binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows on x86_64 and ARM64.

## Install

Pick one. Homebrew and Nix also install yt-dlp, FFmpeg and Deno for you; with the other methods, install them yourself ([see below](#dependencies)). Every method needs a free Spotify API key ([set it up below](#spotify-credentials)).

### Homebrew

macOS and Linux:

```bash
brew install ByteMe6/tap/trackfetch
```

On Intel Macs, Homebrew builds the dependencies from source, so the first install takes a while.

### Nix

Linux and Apple Silicon Macs, with flakes enabled:

```bash
nix run github:ByteMe6/trackfetch -- songs.txt   # run without installing
nix profile install github:ByteMe6/trackfetch    # install
```

### pipx

```bash
pipx install trackfetch
```

### Standalone binary

No Python required. Download the file for your system from the [latest release](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest):

| | x86_64 | ARM64 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Linux** | [`trackfetch-linux-x86_64`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest/download/trackfetch-linux-x86_64) | [`trackfetch-linux-arm64`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest/download/trackfetch-linux-arm64) |
| **macOS** | [`trackfetch-macos-x86_64`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest/download/trackfetch-macos-x86_64) (Intel) | [`trackfetch-macos-arm64`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest/download/trackfetch-macos-arm64) (Apple Silicon) |
| **Windows** | [`trackfetch-windows-x86_64.exe`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest/download/trackfetch-windows-x86_64.exe) | [`trackfetch-windows-arm64.exe`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/releases/latest/download/trackfetch-windows-arm64.exe) |

On Linux and macOS, make it executable and put it on your `PATH`:

```bash
chmod +x trackfetch-linux-x86_64
sudo mv trackfetch-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/trackfetch
```

On macOS, if Gatekeeper blocks the unsigned binary, run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine trackfetch-macos-*` once. Checksums are in `SHA256SUMS.txt` on each release.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch.git
cd trackfetch
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies

With pipx, a standalone binary or a source install, put these on your `PATH`:

| Tool | Used for | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) | Searching and downloading from YouTube | `pipx install yt-dlp` · `brew install yt-dlp` · `winget install yt-dlp` |
| [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) | Converting the audio to MP3 | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` · `brew install ffmpeg` · `winget install ffmpeg` |
| [Deno](https://deno.com/) | JavaScript runtime that yt-dlp needs for YouTube | `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh \| sh` · `brew install deno` · `winget install DenoLand.Deno` |

## Spotify credentials

trackfetch uses Spotify's Client Credentials flow: no Spotify login, no access to your account.

1. Open the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and click **Create app**.
2. Enter any name and description. For the redirect URI, enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`. trackfetch never uses it, but the form requires one.
3. Open the app's **Settings** and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. Set them as environment variables:

<details open>
<summary><b>bash / zsh</b></summary>

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>fish</b></summary>

```fish
set -Ux SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID 'your-client-id'
set -Ux SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET 'your-client-secret'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PowerShell</b></summary>

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID', 'your-client-id', 'User')
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET', 'your-client-secret', 'User')
```

</details>

> [!CAUTION]
> Spotipy caches the access token in a `.cache` file in the current directory. Don't commit it or share it.

## Quick start

```bash
cat > songs.txt <<'EOF'
# My playlist
Daft Punk - One More Time
Radiohead - Paranoid Android
Korol i Shut - Мёртвый Анархист
EOF

trackfetch songs.txt
```

The files land in `~/Music/trackfetch/`.

## Playlists from streaming services

You don't have to type the list by hand. [TuneMyMusic](https://www.tunemymusic.com/) exports playlists from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Deezer, Tidal, SoundCloud and other services to a text file that trackfetch reads as is:

1. On [tunemymusic.com](https://www.tunemymusic.com/), choose the service your playlist is on as the source.
2. Select the playlists you want.
3. Choose **Export to file** as the destination and save it as **TXT**.
4. Run trackfetch on the exported file:

```bash
trackfetch "My Playlist.txt" -o ~/Music/"My Playlist"
```

## Usage

```text
trackfetch [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [--title-only] [--delay DELAY] input
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | required | Text file with one `Artist - Title` per line |
| `-o`, `--output` | `~/Music/trackfetch` | Folder to save the MP3s in. It's created if it doesn't exist. |
| `--title-only` | off | Name files `Title.mp3` instead of `Artist - Title.mp3` |
| `--delay` | `1.0` | Seconds to wait between songs. Raise it for long lists. |

```bash
trackfetch songs.txt -o ~/Music/RoadTrip          # save to a specific folder
trackfetch songs.txt -o /media/usb --title-only   # short names for a car stereo
trackfetch big-list.txt --delay 3                 # go easy on rate limits
```

### Input file

```text
# Lines starting with "#" are comments. Blank lines are ignored.
Daft Punk - One More Time
Sufjan Stevens - Mystery of Love - Remastered   ← only the first " - " separates artist and title
```

The separator is space, hyphen, space (` - `). Lines without it are skipped. See [`examples/songs.txt`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/blob/master/examples/songs.txt).

### Output folder

```text
~/Music/trackfetch/
├── Daft Punk - One More Time.mp3
├── Radiohead - Paranoid Android.mp3
├── done.txt      ← finished songs, skipped on the next run
└── failed.txt    ← "Artist - Title | reason" for each song that failed
```

**Retry failures** by stripping the reasons from `failed.txt` and running it again:

```bash
cut -d '|' -f 1 ~/Music/trackfetch/failed.txt > retry.txt
trackfetch retry.txt
```

**Re-download a song** by deleting its MP3 and its line in `done.txt`.

### Cheat sheet

A [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) page is in [`docs/tldr/trackfetch.md`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/blob/master/docs/tldr/trackfetch.md). To use it with [tealdeer](https://github.com/tealdeer-rs/tealdeer), copy it into your custom pages folder as `trackfetch.page.md`.

## How it works

1. **Find the song on Spotify.** trackfetch searches for `artist:"…" track:"…"` and falls back to a looser search if nothing comes back. Every result is scored by fuzzy similarity, 70% title and 30% artist, and the best one supplies the official spelling, all credited artists, the album details and the cover.
2. **Find the audio on YouTube.** It searches YouTube for the official artist and title and scores the top five results:

   | Signal | Effect on the score |
   | --- | --- |
   | Similarity to the song title | × 0.70 |
   | Similarity to the artist | × 0.30 |
   | `official audio` in the video title | +0.08 |
   | `audio` in the video title | +0.03 |
   | `cover`, `karaoke`, `караоке`, `nightcore`, `sped up`, `slowed`, `remix`, `reaction` | −0.20 each |

3. **Download.** yt-dlp downloads only the winning video and converts it to MP3.
4. **Tag.** trackfetch replaces any existing tags with these ID3v2.3 frames:

   | Frame | Content |
   | --- | --- |
   | `TIT2` | Title |
   | `TPE1` | Artists |
   | `TALB` | Album |
   | `TPE2` | Album artist |
   | `TRCK` | Track number |
   | `TDRC` | Release date |
   | `APIC` | Front cover, up to 640×640 |

If Spotify has no match, the song is still downloaded and tagged with the artist and title from your file.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b><code>ERROR: Spotify credentials not found.</code></b></summary>

`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` aren't set in this terminal. See [Spotify credentials](#spotify-credentials).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Every song fails with <code>no YouTube result</code> or <code>yt-dlp download failed</code></b></summary>

YouTube changes often. Update yt-dlp first with `pipx upgrade yt-dlp` or `yt-dlp -U`. Recent versions of yt-dlp also need Deno: check that `deno --version` works in the same terminal.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>ERROR: Postprocessing: ffprobe and ffmpeg not found</code></b></summary>

Install FFmpeg and check that `ffmpeg -version` works in the same terminal.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The wrong version of a song was downloaded</b></summary>

Make the line in your file more specific, for example by using the exact title as Spotify spells it. Then delete the MP3 and its line in `done.txt` and run trackfetch again. If it keeps picking the wrong upload, [open an issue](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) with the `YouTube score` lines from the output.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>HTTP 429 or other rate-limit errors</b></summary>

Raise `--delay`, for example to `3`. Stopped runs continue where they left off.

</details>

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]" ruff
ruff check .
pytest --cov=trackfetch
```

The tests stub every network and subprocess call, so they run offline in under a second. To build a standalone binary yourself, run `pip install pyinstaller && pyinstaller trackfetch.spec`; it ends up in `dist/`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request.

### Releasing

Every push to `master` runs the tests on Linux, macOS and Windows. When `version` in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/blob/master/pyproject.toml) has no matching `vX.Y.Z` tag yet, the [Build & Release](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow also builds all six binaries and publishes a release, using that version's section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/ByteMe6/trackfetch/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) as the notes.

To release, move the changes under `[Unreleased]` in the changelog to a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section, bump `version`, and push.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bump the version in a commit that doesn't edit `.github/workflows/`. GitHub doesn't let the workflow token tag a commit that changes workflow files, so the release step would fail with a 403.
